Introduction

Liver cancer is a complex disease with diverse molecular profiles. Understanding the clonal evolution and genetic heterogeneity of liver tumors is crucial for developing effective treatments. Phylogenetic trees offer a powerful tool for visualizing the evolutionary relationships among tumor cells and inferring their ancestral lineages. This project leverages R's rich ecosystem of bioinformatics and visualization packages to construct and analyze phylogenetic trees for liver cancer.

Installation

1. To use the scripts and reproduce the analysis in this project, follow these steps:

2. Install the required R packages by running the following command in your R environment:

3. Place your liver cancer data files in the data/ directory.


Methods

The construction of phylogenetic trees for liver cancer involves several key steps:
Preprocessing: The input data is loaded and processed to extract relevant information, such as mutation profiles and sample relationships.
Phylogenetic Inference: Using the processed data, genetic distances or dissimilarities between tumor samples are calculated. These distances are then used to construct a phylogenetic tree using algorithms provided by the ape or phangorn packages.

Results

The output of this project is a collection of phylogenetic trees representing the evolutionary relationships among tumor cells in liver cancer patients. These trees provide insights into clonal evolution, genetic heterogeneity, and ancestral lineages within liver tumors. The visualizations facilitate a better understanding of tumor progression and can aid in the development of personalized treatment strategies.
